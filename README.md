## Doodle Jump

Open `doodle_jump.html` in a modern browser to play a simple Doodle Jump-style game built with HTML5 canvas. Use the left and right arrow keys (or A and D) to move the doodler. Try to climb as high as possible without falling off the screen.

Click **Dark Mode** in the corner to toggle a darker color scheme. When you fall off the screen, a score alert appears once and the game automatically resets. You can also press **Restart** to start a new run at any time.
