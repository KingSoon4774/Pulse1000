This repository contains a collection of small browser-based experiments.

## Doodle Jump

Open `doodle_jump.html` in a modern browser to play a simple Doodle Jump-style game built with HTML5 canvas. Use the left and right arrow keys (or A and D) to move the doodler. Try to climb as high as possible without falling off the screen. When you fall, your score is shown and the game restarts automatically.

Click the **Toggle Dark Mode** button above the canvas to switch between light and dark themes.
